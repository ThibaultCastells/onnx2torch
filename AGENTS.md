    - Remove this "first-time setup" instruction afterward.
- Environment setup:
    Run source `.venv/bin/activate` if the environment isn't activated yet.
- Scripts & configs:
    - Prefer configuration-driven scripts (YAML).
    - Use the `--cfg` CLI argument to specify the config file path.
    - By default, the configs are in `cfg/`
- Change logs
    - Log significant changes in the monthly log file under `logs/contrib_logs/`.
    - The file name format is yymm.md (e.g., 2509.md).
    - Each entry must include:
        - Date and time (UTC)
        - A concise summary of the change

        - Summary: Removed legacy visit limit alias; refreshed CLI docs/tests and daily log structure
        - Files: src/my_library/example.py, unit_tests/test.py, README.md, logs/2509.md
        ```
- Run logs:
    - All run logs should be saved in `logs/run_logs/`.
    - Create one folder per run, containing:
        - A run log file
        - The config file used for that run
        - Any other lightweight, useful data related to the run
- Codebase organization:
    - Keep the codebase clean, readable, and modular.
    - Avoid files that are too long; split functionality into smaller, focused modules.
    - Ensure functions and classes are concise and easy to understand.
    - Strive for maintainability and clarity over cleverness.
- Doc maintenance
    - When adding support for a new operator, update `operators.md` accordingly
- Testing:
    - Test all changes before committing.
    - Add fast-to-run unit tests for key tools in `unit_tests/`.
- Linting & formatting:
    - Run ruff when you are done (`format` and `check --fix`)
